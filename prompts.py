    "- Leading the development of a novel, AI-driven Business Intelligence platform as Co-Founder/CTO.\n"
    "- Scaled a data architecture to support millions of users (at Docsity).\n"
    "- Designed and built a new data architecture from the ground up (at Arm).\n"

    "- 10-9: Perfect match. The job explicitly asks for AI/ML and Data in a freelance capacity.\n"
    "- 8-7: Strong match. The job asks for Data Engineering/Architecture *or* AI/ML Engineering.\n"
    "- 6-4: Partial match. The job is for a general Dev/Tech or 'Backend Engineer' where my skills are relevant but not a perfect fit. Or the role is too junior (e.g., 'Data Analyst').\n"
