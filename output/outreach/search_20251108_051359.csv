About Upfluence

Upfluence helps brands tell their story with powerful influencer & content marketing technology. Upfluence’s software allows brands and agencies to identify and contact millions of social influencers and bloggers at scale to execute comprehensive influencer marketing campaigns, as well as provide detailed reporting metrics. Since the launch of our SaaS software in October 2016, the company has yielded a monthly double-digit growth rate, and we are therefore seeking further expansion for our team and offices. Our rapidly growing global team is currently distributed between our offices in NYC, Los Angeles, and Lyon.



What We Do

We aggregate and serve content from over 12 million influencers across all major social platforms, helping thousands of daily users make sense of massive amounts of data.

This means tackling exciting challenges around user experience, performance, and scalability.

Our frontend is a large single-page application built with Ember.js, communicating with multiple backend APIs. The architecture is modular, divided into sub-projects following the Ember Engines pattern, which keeps it flexible and maintainable.

We maintain our own component library to ensure design consistency and fast iteration across the app, all while expressing the Upfluence brand identity.

We’re DevOps-minded: every frontend engineer ships to production several times per day and owns their applications end-to-end.

Thanks to automation with GitHub Actions and our in-house deployment tools:

- Every PR gets its own preview environment automatically.



- Every merge to main is auto-deployed to staging.



We believe in microservices, automation, and continuous improvement; our backend runs around 50 apps, 1,600 containers, and we’re always optimizing how it all connects.

Most importantly, we’re product-driven: we build to serve our users, not just to ship features.



How We Work

We believe collective intelligence is the foundation of great engineering.

Everyone has a voice in technical discussions through proposals and RFCs; we design, build, and learn together.

Our team follows a Scrum workflow with 2-week sprints, combining focus and flexibility.

Each sprint includes clear goals, demos, and retrospectives to help us continuously improve how we work and deliver.

We also love open source and regularly share our internal libraries with the community.



Your Role

As a Software Engineer, you will:

- Build and maintain high-quality, reliable, and tested UI code.
- Be involved throughout the feature lifecycle, from design and technical planning to deployment and long-term maintenance.
- Collaborate closely with designers, backend engineers, and product managers to deliver smooth, impactful user experiences.
- Participate in code reviews, mentor peers, and write technical RFCs.
- Partner with our Customer Success and Support teams to make sure our users have the best possible experience.



What we are looking for

You don’t need to be an Ember.js expert; we’re looking for curious developers eager to learn, grow, and master their craft.

You’ll thrive here if you:

- Have experience with modern JavaScript frameworks (Ember.js, React, Vue, etc.).
- Understand web fundamentals: HTML, CSS, accessibility, and performance.
- Communicate clearly and proactively, both in code and in writing.
- Are fluent or comfortable working in English (French not required).
- Are reliable, collaborative, and not afraid to ask questions.
- Care deeply about delivering great user experiences and useful products.



What we have to offer

- A dynamic, international, and diverse team (20+ nationalities).
- A culture of autonomy, collaboration, and impact.
- Regular exchanges with our US and France offices.
- Stock options and career growth opportunities.
- Flexible hybrid or fully remote setup.
- A supportive team that mixes serious tech with a good sense of humor (yes, we do make bad jokes on Discord).
- …and maybe even the answer to life, the universe, and everything.

Sounds like the perfect opportunity? Apply now to join us!



We offer a flexible hybrid work model, providing our employees with an office setting, the option to work from home, and even fully remote structures. We believe in work-life balance and provide access so we can make the best of our workdays.
