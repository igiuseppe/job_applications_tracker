4338149831,Solutions Architect,"CHI SIAMO

Keplero AI è una startup fondata a fine 2023 con forti ambizioni di crescita. Stiamo rivoluzionando il modo in cui le aziende parlano con i propri clienti.

Addestriamo modelli di intelligenza artificiale con i dati delle aziende e li installiamo su tutti i canali di comunicazione, incluso il telefono. Tutto viene gestito da un’unica potente piattaforma che conta già ad oggi oltre 400 clienti all’attivo.

Keplero AI aiuta migliaia di consumatori accelerando i tempi di risoluzione dei loro dubbi e problematiche, e fa risparmiare centinaia di ore ai nostri clienti.



COSA FARAI

Il tuo ruolo sarà fondamentale per portare i nostri clienti online il più velocemente possibile . Non sarai un semplice esecutore, ma il ponte tra tecnologia e business:

- Sviluppo di integrazioni custom : MCP, API REST, flussi N8N e automazioni su sistemi dei clienti.
- Ottimizzazione dei flussi di onboarding : ogni minuto risparmiato qui vale oro per noi e per i clienti.
- Sviluppo di tool interni : crea strumenti che semplifichino il lavoro di tutto il team - dalla vendita al supporto.
- Interazione diretta con i clienti : parlerai con persone di varia provenienza - dal CTO di una banca al responsabile customer service di una compagnia aerea.
- Problem solving : i clienti hanno bisogno di soluzioni, velocemente.
- Gestione ticket custom : ogni cliente è diverso, ogni richiesta è una sfida nuova.

Le soluzioni che troverai non sono il fine ma il mezzo . L'obiettivo è attivare i nostri clienti, non scrivere codice perfetto.



COME LAVORIAMO (E PERCHÉ)

Il nostro obiettivo è tagliare i tempi per portare i clienti online . Questo significa:

- Velocità sopra tutto: usiamo l'AI per sviluppare e lavorare più velocemente
- Gestione totale del cliente: seguiamo il cliente dall'onboarding al supporto continuo
- Grande autonomia: essendo il team snello, ciascuno può portare e argomentare nuove idee
- Zero burocrazia interna: se c'è un modo migliore per fare qualcosa, lo facciamo



HARD SKILLS

- Sviluppo tramite strumenti AI : la velocità è cruciale. Se non usi Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor o simili per accelerare lo sviluppo, non facciamo match.
- JavaScript e TypeScript : conoscenza base solida. Non devi essere un guru, ma devi essere a tuo agio.
- Grande creatività : spesso non esiste la soluzione pronta, devi inventarla.
- Capacità di astrarre : creare soluzioni riusabili ti farà risparmiare ore o giorni di lavoro.
- Buona conoscenza di Git



SOFT SKILLS

- Empatia verso i clienti : capirai rapidamente che dietro ogni ticket c'è una persona che ha bisogno di aiuto.
- Capacità di cambiare vocabolario : con un CTO parli di API, con un responsabile customer service parli di ""come risponde il bot"".
- Grande autonomia : totale fiducia nelle proprie skill. Non avrai qualcuno che ti dice cosa fare step-by-step.
- Proattività : se vedi un problema, lo risolvi. Se hai un'idea, la proponi.



NICE TO HAVE

- Goal-centered mindset : se c'è un modo per fare ciò che si vuole, lo si trova. Sempre.
- Entrepreneurial background : ci vuole fame. Vogliamo persone che hanno voglia di costruire qualcosa di grande.
- Progetti personali : side projects, esperimenti, weekend hacks - tutto quello che mostra creatività e passione.



COSA OFFRIAMO

- €35.000-€50.000 di RAL . Sappiamo che tutto questo impegno deve essere retribuito adeguatamente.
- Crescita reale : essendo tra i primi del team, garantiamo una crescita professionale e di RAL in relazione alla crescita aziendale.
- Impatto concreto : ogni integrazione che costruisci, ogni tool che crei, ogni cliente che onbordi fa la differenza.
- Ambiente startup reale : in pochi mesi vedrai e imparerai cose che altrove vedresti in anni. Alto livello di responsabilità e coinvolgimento.
- Team che dà valore al risultato : lavorerai con persone che tengono alla qualità di ciò che producono.
- Possibilità di esplorare : il ruolo non è esclusivo. Se vorrai, potrai esplorare anche Backend, DevOps, o altre aree del prodotto. Crediamo che un vero professionista non sia una persona settorializzata.

4339660041,AI/LLM Trainers (Italy),"Company Description

As a trusted Oracle Partner, MillionLogics stands as a global powerhouse in IT solutions, merging innovation, expertise, and strategic vision. With offices in London, UK, and a development hub in Hyderabad, India, MillionLogics bridges sharp business foresight with world-class technical talent. Our mission is to transform enterprises through smart, scalable IT solutions, including Data & AI services, Cloud solutions, and IT consulting. We empower organisations to evolve and lead, delivering tailored, results-driven technology solutions backed by our team of 25+ Oracle experts.



Role Description

This is a contract remote role for AI/LLM Trainer (Italian language Specialist) at MillionLogics. This position is within a project with one of the reputed clients, which is an LLM company based in the USA. The goal is to assist the clients in enhancing their large language models.



One way we help these companies improve their models is by providing them with high-quality proprietary data. This data serves two main purposes: first, as a basis for fine-tuning their models, and second, as an evaluation set to benchmark the performance of their models or competitor models.



For example, in the case of Agent Completion (AC) data generation, your task will be to simulate high-quality multi-turn conversations between a user and a smart assistant that utilises function-calling tools to accomplish user goals. You will craft these dialogues by playing both the assistant and the user, while simulating tool use where necessary to guide the assistant through complex decision-making and real-world reasoning scenarios.



What does day-to-day look like:

- Design multi-turn conversations that simulate real interactions between users and AI assistants using apps like Calendar, email, maps, and Drive.
- Emulate both the user and the assistant, including the assistant's tool calls (only when corrections are needed).
- Carefully select when and how the assistant uses available tools, ensuring logical flow and proper usage of function calls.
- Craft dialogues that demonstrate natural language, intelligent behaviour, and contextual understanding across multiple turns.
- Generate examples that showcase the assistant’s ability to gracefully complete feasible tasks, recognise infeasible ones, and maintain engaging general chat when tools aren’t required.
- Ensure all conversations adhere to defined formatting and quality guidelines, using an internal playbook.
- Iterate on conversation examples based on feedback to continuously improve realism, clarity, and value for training purposes.
- Collaborate with peers and reviewers to maintain consistency and high standards in deliverables.



Requirements:

- 3+ years of overall professional experience in a technical or analytical field
- Experience in any programming language or tech stack is acceptable; a strong grasp of APIs, data formats (e.g., JSON), and logical thinking is more critical than specific toolsets
- Strong general technical reasoning skills and the ability to model real-world assistant behaviour using tool-based APIs
- Ability to break down complex tasks and simulate realistic dialogues that reflect user expectations and assistant limitations
- Excellent written communication skills in English, with a focus on clarity, tone, and instructional coherence
- Creativity and attention to detail in crafting realistic scenarios and responses
- Experience working with or around LLMs, virtual assistants, or function-calling frameworks is a plus.
- Ability to follow detailed guidelines and formatting standards with high consistency
- Excellent English communication and interpersonal skills
- Ability to work independently and remotely
- Native or professional proficiency in Italian and English languages



Perks of Working With MillionLogics:

- Work in a fully remote environment
- Opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI projects with a leading LLM client based in the U.S.



Offer Details:

- Commitments Required: 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week with an overlap of 4 hours with PST.
- Engagement Type: Contractor assignment (no medical/paid leave)
- Duration of the Contract: 9 months
- Compensation: Competitive

Number of Openings: 15
