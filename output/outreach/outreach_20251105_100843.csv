- Location: Frankfurt office - remote friendly, at least once in the office every 4-6 weeks is ideal. ~50/50 split with current colleagues who are more remote and those who are more in the office. Some client travel for kick offs expected in the DACH region.



Need to already live in Germany | No sponsorship available | C1 German or above



Here's what they're looking for:



- Strong Technical Software Implementation experience for 4+ yrs (experienced mid or senior level) - configuration, integration, testing etc of software solutions for customers / B2B
- Strong experience especially in the deployment phase is important
- Due to the c omplex nature of their solutions & the environments they're implemented in, you'll need to have a technical skillset - e.g. similar role, perhaps you're in cyber or other complex areas in tech
- You'll have similar enterprise & complex/long term project experience - e.g. PLM, ERP, Cyber Implementations etc. PIAM not needed.



Does this sound like you? Great! here's some more info...



Technical Solutions Engineer



Your focus will be on the technical implementation/Deployment of your company's On-premise & Saas Solutions . Your role will span from supporting the pre sales consultants, to being the go to person responsible for the implementation phase where you will be hands-on configuring the software (e.g. 2-factor authentications, connections to other tools, data transfers, etc).



You will work closely with the Solution lead on your projects and the customer to verify requirements, define user stories, specify the solution... then the implementation is over to you with configuration, integration and testing . After that, you will support the successful handover to the customer & your support colleagues.



You can expect to have a project load between 2-4, and you'll be focussed on the DACH region where currently most of the demand is for new implementations of their solutions.



Due to the complex environments their technology suits, you can expect to work with large customers (3-6k employees on average) and projects between 6-12 months on average across Government, Automotive and much more.



They're advocates of diversity in thought and ways of doing things, but you'll be someone who thrives in an environment where processes are evolving as the German office is relatively young in the company history. You can bring in ideas for how things are done, you can work independently etc. You'll be someone who is a natural problem solver, someone who can think in solutions.



Company



This Venture Capital-funded company have been established for almost 20 years in the Identity & Access Management industry providing software & solutions to to well known names internationally. There's just over 100 people in the business spread across 3 different countries, with around 20 in the German team.



Last year they hired more than 10 across their offices and have continued with multiple key hires again this year. Your immediate team is around 5 people and a new head of department joined earlier this year to help shape the future, help you work to your strengths and ambitions etc.



You'll be supported by some super experienced colleagues who will be helping you get up to speed with training, coaching etc on their products and more.

A propos de Mirakl Labs

Nos équipes techniques et produits, nommées Mirakl Labs, sont principalement réparties entre nos 2 hubs situés à Paris et à Bordeaux. Elles collaborent au quotidien afin d'adresser les problématiques de nos clients et utilisateurs en répondant à différents challenges liés aux nouvelles fonctionnalités, à la scalabilité, la sécurité et l’ergonomie…

Elles opèrent en mode agile et s'organisent en Squads composées d'un Squad Lead, de 5 développeurs, d'un Product Manager et d'un QA. Chaque Squad est spécialisée sur un scope fonctionnel afin de concevoir et réaliser de nouvelles features, leurs évolutions et des APIs (avec un découpage en micro-services). Nos équipes Infrastructure, Architecture, Sécurité, Documentation, Product Design, Data et Support opèrent en transverse en apportant leur expertise et de la cohérence sur l’ensemble des produits.

Toutes les équipes sont responsables de leur périmètre et chacun des collaborateurs apporte son expérience et ses idées. Innovation, feedback et implication dans les prises de décision sont au cœur de notre philosophie.

Et pour favoriser ce partage avec d’autres passionnés, nous sommes sponsors, speakers, et hôtes de différents événements, meetups, et associations de la scène Tech en France. Au cours des dernières années, nous avons participé à des événements tels que Devoxx, ReactEurope, ProductConf et Flupa UX Days.

With over a decade of experience and a reputation built on delivering for Fortune 500s and blockchain ecosystems, our teams combine deep technical know-how with a mission to enable meaningful, decentralized innovation.

As a remote-first, engineering-driven team, we work with autonomy and purpose. Our culture is built on meritocracy, long-term thinking, and a commitment to quality over buzz. We aim to collaborate with people who love tech for its own sake and want to help shape the future by solving real-world challenges.

About the role

We are looking for an experienced Full Stack Engineer who thrives in a self-managed environment and is passionate about solving real-world problems through software. In this role, you'll work across the stack—from frontend to backend—collaborating directly with customers to deeply understand their needs and translate them into elegant, intuitive, and scalable solutions.

You should be someone who cares about the user experience as much as the code behind it. You will bring empathy into your technical decisions, always keeping the end-user in mind, and aren't afraid to propose bold, innovative ideas to improve the product—even before anyone asks for them.

This is a role for a thoughtful engineer who can drive features end-to-end, from conception to delivery, while maintaining a strong focus on code quality, performance, and maintainability. You will work with modern technologies (Angular, TypeScript, Kotlin, Swift, etc.) and contribute to open-source tools and libraries as part of our wider engineering efforts.

You’ll be a critical thinker, a proactive problem solver, and a creative partner to both our team and our customers.

- Build impactful features end-to-end — from backend logic to beautiful, user-friendly UIs — that solve real problems for real users
- Work directly with customers to deeply understand their needs, frustrations, and workflows — and then surprise them with thoughtful, innovative solutions
- Prototype fast, iterate smart — explore new ideas quickly and refine them based on feedback, data, and your own UX instincts
- Own projects from concept to deployment — you're not just writing code, you're helping define what gets built and why
- Craft clean, testable, and scalable code — with attention to long-term maintainability and engineering excellence
- Contribute to open-source tools and internal libraries that benefit the broader engineering team and community
- Collaborate with design and product to ensure every feature feels intuitive, polished, and purposeful
- Continuously improve what already exists — whether it’s refactoring legacy systems or improving app performance for a smoother experience
- Bring new ideas to the table — we love engineers who challenge assumptions and think beyond the obvious
