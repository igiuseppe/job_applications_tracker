4340544859,(Junior) Litigation Lawyer for Airline Passengers Claims,"*Please, only apply if you have a valid Attorney at Law license and are authorised to practise law by the Regulation Authority in PORTUGAL and you have litigation experience in Portugal.*



Instead of a CV, please attach a simple Word file describing your experience in airline passenger claims under EU261/2004 or baggage claims under Montreal Convention in English.



About Us

✈️At AirAdvisor , we are dedicated to ensuring air travelers receive the compensation they are entitled to for flight disruptions. Whether it’s a delay, cancellation, missed connection , or an airline-related issue like overbooking . In June 2025, we introduced a new service for baggage claims related to lost, delayed, or destroyed luggage . We are present in the EU, the UK, and other international markets, with a focus on protecting air passenger rights globally. We have successfully processed over 530,000 claims for clients from 221 countries , earning a 4.7-star rating based on over 27,800 reviews . Currently operating in 21 languages (with nine more forthcoming this year), AirAdvisor is an ambitious and fast-growing startup with a clear vision for international expansion. We plan to reach 1 million claims by the end of 2026. ✈️



We are seeking a skilled and dedicated Litigation Lawyer specializing in consumer flight claims (typically via small claims procedures) to lead in-court collections. Pre-court collections are managed by a team of paralegals. You will be responsible for filing batches of court cases to collect compensation and/or reimbursement of Out-of-Pocket Expenses (OPE) incurred by passengers and/or recover ticket refunds. AirAdvisor currently handles three types of airline claims: EU261 compensation for flight delays, cancellations, and denied boarding, as well as two types of baggage claims under the Montreal Convention: lost and delayed luggage.



If the law or a judge decides the case unfairly, we would consider escalating this to change the law, if feasible. There may be PR opportunities to highlight court victories and key legal issues that deserve public attention. This is an excellent opportunity for high performers who can self-perform, have strong litigation experience, and have a passion for advocating consumer rights in the airline industry.

- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills to assess case merits, conduct legal research, and develop effective legal strategies.
- Ability to manage a caseload, prioritize tasks, meet deadlines, and track statute of limitations.
- Experience in automating and standardizing claims management processes to scale up quickly.



Responsibilities:

- Act as the legal representative of AirAdvisor in Portugal , handling all legal matters and claims filed within the jurisdiction. If setting up a law firm in Portugal were feasible, you would be expected to assist in this matter, including, but not limited to, corporate structuring, registering Mr. Anton Radchenko on the official list of foreign legal counsels in Portugal, and other formalities.
- Pre-court collections and out-of-court settlements.
- Prepare and file batches of approx. 200+ legal new claims monthly in Portuguese courts against various airlines for the purpose of recovering:

(a) Compensation under EU Regulation 261/2004 and/or Turkish SHY Regulation for flight delays, cancellations, and denied boarding.

(b) Reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by passengers under EU261/2004, and/or the Montreal Convention.

(c) Ticket refunds owed to passengers under applicable legal frameworks.

(d) Handle baggage-related claims , including cases of delayed, damaged, or lost luggage, in accordance with the provisions of the Montreal Convention and/or Warsaw Convention.

- Respond comprehensively and assertively to airline legal defenses , including substantive arguments as well as procedural and jurisdictional challenges.
- Lead the enforcement of court judgments , including initiating enforcement proceedings and coordinating with bailiffs or enforcement authorities when necessary.
- Engage in court-led settlement negotiations , and where applicable, represent AirAdvisor’s interests in securing favorable in-court settlements.
- Maintain complete and accurate legal case files , ensuring all work complies with Portuguese legal ethics, data protection regulations, and professional standards. Conduct thorough legal research and comparative analysis to compile best practices for managing recurring legal issues in airline and consumer rights litigation.
- Stay informed about developments in consumer protection law , aviation regulations, EU regulations, and judicial precedents in order to provide updated, authoritative legal advice and representation.
- Where applicable, and if a court decision is rendered unjustly, pursue legal remedies, including appeals , and advocate for legislative changes , if strategically and procedurally feasible.
- Support the optimization and automation of claims management workflows , leveraging legal technology solutions, including AI-based tools, to improve efficiency and scalability.
- Identify and propose new civil claims business opportunities that are viable under Portuguese law and offer low-value, high-volume litigation potential. Areas may include, but are not limited to:

(a) Bank and financial disputes, Labour law-related claims, etc.

(b) Conduct cross-jurisdictional legal research , primarily across EU and UK markets, to identify relevant precedents and advanced practices that may be adapted for use in Portugal in more complex claim scenarios.

- Represent AirAdvisor in local media , including giving interviews to press outlets, television broadcasters, and podcast programs. Coordinate with AirAdvisor’s PR Manager to take advantage of public relations opportunities surrounding landmark court rulings or critical legal developments, with the goal of enhancing public awareness of consumer rights.
- Review and vet content as needed, aka serve as in-country content reviewer of record to help build local trust and boost authority.
- Advocate for passenger and consumer rights within the airline and travel industry, promoting fair treatment and legal protection for air travellers.

The Role

We’re looking for a Back-End Engineer with strong expertise in designing secure, scalable systems and an entrepreneurial drive to help build a company from the ground up.

As a founding engineer, you’ll architect core server-side logic, APIs, and integrations while ensuring performance, reliability, and security across our platform. You’ll also help shape the technical roadmap as we scale post-launch.

- Define and maintain CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployments
- Write tests, debug issues, and document system architecture



What You Bring

- 4+ years of experience in back-end development
- Strong proficiency in Java & Spring Boot for microservices and server logic
- Experience integrating Stripe.js or other payment solutions
- Expertise in API design (RESTful/GraphQL) with secure authentication (OAuth2, JWT)
- Hands-on experience with databases (SQL + NoSQL) and optimization
- Solid understanding of AWS cloud services and scalable architectures
- Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines, Git, and containerization (Docker/Kubernetes a plus)
- Strong problem-solving, communication, and ownership mindset
- Entrepreneurial spirit, comfortable building in ambiguity, focused on execution and growth



Why Join Gler

- Up to 1,000,000 shares in equity-based compensation
- Strategic co-founder role with significant influence over tech direction
- Be part of the genesis team, before we scale 10x post-launch
- Remote-first, ownership-driven culture
- No red tape, just impact, speed, and collaboration



Who This Role is For

- Back-end engineers who want more than a job, they want ownership
- Builders excited to shape something transformative from scratch
- Entrepreneurs who have dreamed of starting a company but needed the right team

4335968850,Banbrytande HR-chef,"Om:



Phrolo, som uttalas ”Frolo”, grundades hösten 2023 och har som mål att revolutionera QVT-sektorn med hjälp av en teknisk och välvillig approach.



Tack vare en framgångsrik crowdfundingkampanj och ett första verksamhetsår utvecklas Phrolo i full fart.



Vårt mål:



Att erbjuda ett alternativ mellan ”jag gör ingenting” och ”jag går i psykoterapi” genom att vara en följeslagare, en välvillig, vänlig och empatisk vän, en förtrogen som alltid finns tillgänglig för anställda eller medarbetare i offentliga eller privata organisationer.



Efter ett års verksamhet utvecklar Phrolo sin app!



Vi inleder med motivation nästa steg i vår utveckling, drivna av en gemensam vilja att förbättra allas mentala välbefinnande och HR-avdelningarnas styrning av ett sådant projekt.



Bakgrund:



Phrolo utvecklar för närvarande sin plattform och sin applikation för att stödja HR-avdelningar och team i frågor som rör mental hälsa och välbefinnande i vardagen.

Vi inleder nästa steg i vår utveckling och söker inte en anställd, utan en pionjärpartner, en visionär kund som vill delta i utvecklingen av en innovativ lösning som kombinerar teknik, omsorg och mänsklig prestation.



- Din roll:



Som pionjärkund kommer du att spela en aktiv roll i vårt innovationsarbete:



Ditt företag blir kund och implementerar därmed Phrolo internt mot betalning (med ekonomiska fördelar).

Du bidrar till vår strategiska planering: erfarenheter, behov, utmaningar, förväntningar på fältet.

Du deltar i 2–3 sessioner per år (online eller på plats) för att utmana produktinriktningen, UX, data, FoU eller affärsverksamheten.

Du främjar utbytet mellan kollegor och partners för att bygga upp ett välvilligt nätverk kring förbättrad arbetsmiljö.



Sökprofil:

Är du HR-chef, QVT-ansvarig eller företagsledare med minst 20 anställda, med känsla för frågor som rör mental hälsa, engagemang och hållbar prestanda?



Gillar du att utforska nya tillvägagångssätt, testa före andra och bidra till utvecklingen inom din bransch?

Då är den här rollen något för dig: bli vår privilegierade kontaktperson, vår pionjärkund inom Phrolo.



Process:



Ett enkelt samtal med VD:n för att diskutera våra respektive visioner och definiera formen för ditt deltagande.



Ett gratis och omfattande test av vår lösning.



Och det är allt!



Samarbetsplats: 100 % distansarbete.

Startdatum: enligt överenskommelse.

Ersättning: ej tillämpligt – strategiskt och samarbetsinriktat engagemang.
