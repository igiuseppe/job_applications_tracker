🌻 Nos valeurs

« Je » est ordinaire, « Nous » est extraordinaire

Cette valeur souligne l'importance du travail d'équipe et de la collaboration. Le succès collectif surpasse toujours les réalisations individuelles.

Maîtriser un sujet, c'est savoir l'expliquer simplement

La clarté et la simplicité sont des signes de véritable expertise. Si tu ne peux pas expliquer quelque chose simplement, c’est que tu ne le maîtrises pas encore assez.

Une erreur est une leçon, la reproduire est un choix

Nous encourageons l’apprentissage par l’expérience et acceptons les erreurs comme source d’évolution. La vraie erreur n’est pas de se tromper, mais de ne pas en tirer les enseignements. Répéter une même erreur devient inacceptable car cela démontre un refus d’apprendre.

Quand l’évidence s’arrête, l’ingéniosité commence

Les défis complexes exigent des solutions créatives. C’est dans ces moments que notre capacité d’innovation fait la différence.

Repousser, c’est renoncer

L’action immédiate est privilégiée. Procrastiner équivaut souvent à abandonner nos objectifs et opportunités.

La parole est précieuse, elle construit des ponts, pas des murs

La communication doit être constructive et unificatrice. Nos échanges visent à rapprocher les personnes et à créer des liens positifs.

L’excellence ciblée sur l’essentiel accélère le progrès

Se concentrer sur les priorités clés avec excellence, plutôt que de disperser ses efforts, permet d’avancer plus rapidement et efficacement.",DotWorld,https://ch.linkedin.com/company/dotworld-sarl?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name,https://fr.linkedin.com/jobs/view/candidature-spontan%C3%A9e-at-dotworld-4298603855?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title,2025-11-06 15:25:09,Noémie N.,https://fr.linkedin.com/in/no%C3%A9mienanagassa/en,,,"Bonjour Noémie,

I saw your Data Engineer role at ZABEL and wanted to reach out, not as an applicant for the full-time position, but as a freelance expert who can deliver immediate impact.

My experience scaling data architectures for millions of users at Docsity and building new data architectures from the ground up at Arm aligns perfectly with your need to build robust data foundations.

If you're open to exploring how a seasoned Data & AI Engineer with a startup mindset can accelerate your data product development, I'd welcome a brief call."
