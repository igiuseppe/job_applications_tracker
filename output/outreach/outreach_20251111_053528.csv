4321678227,Product Designer,"We are looking for a mid-level Product Designer to join our remote team!

We're building something ambitious at Code & Co: an AI-first ecosystem of apps and services that change the way due diligence gets done.



But, before we dive into that, what is Code & Co ?



We specialize in Tech and Product Due Diligence. This means working with the world's leading investors (private equity, growth funds, etc.) and helping them make informed investment decisions.

We've been around for over nine years and partnered with many of the world's leading investment funds along the way, all while remaining proudly bootstrapped. No VC funding or growth-at-all-costs mentality. Instead, we've built something rare: a small, dedicated, profitable team who care deeply about our craft but not about ceremony.



The thing about due diligence is it's traditionally been a very manual, very spreadsheet-heavy affair. Investors hire consultants who spend weeks digging through codebases, asking the same questions on repeat, and endlessly tinkering with Powerpoint to create their reports.

We've rejected that model. From the outset, we've sought to automate the mundane so our consultants can focus on the intellectually interesting stuff. Our products, tools, and AI agents now shoulder a huge amount of heavy lifting that would once have required an army of analysts.

Looking further ahead, we have a growing list of new products that we can't wait to bring to life. This is where you come in!



You'll be thinking through user problems, helping to define what we build, and bringing these solutions to life through product management and design.

You're the kind of person who sees a manual process and immediately thinks ""there has to be a better way."" You like talking to users, understanding their problems, and framing the solution space along with us. You're comfortable making product decisions: prioritizing features, defining scope, and making trade-offs between user needs and business goals.



You have an interest in presenting complex information to a non-technical audience, as well as the ability to take on some marketing design as we take some of our new products to the market.



We're looking for

- 3+ years working with B2B products across both design and product management responsibilities
- Strong visual skills, a deep understanding of design principles, typography, layout, and composition
- Strong skills in interaction design, visual design, responsive design and information architecture
- Proven ability to ship impactful features from 0→1 and iterate based on real-world feedback
- Ability to define product strategy, write specs, and make prioritization decisions

Nice to haves

- Proficiency in Figma or comparable tools
- Experience designing AI-driven products or other complex, emerging tech experiences



How to apply

Email us at careers+product-designer@codeandco.com.

Include your CV and a link to your Portfolio but, more importantly, tell us a bit about yourself. We're not looking for a formal cover letter filled with corporate speak or AI slop. We want to hear your voice.



Tell us what you are looking for in your next role and something that is interesting to you in the product space right now.



In short: be yourself. If you're the kind of person who gets excited about crafting elegant product-based solutions to real world problems then we probably want to speak with you :)",Code & Co.,https://de.linkedin.com/company/codeandcoberlin?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name,https://de.linkedin.com/jobs/view/product-designer-at-code-co-4321678227?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title,2025-11-10 17:17:36,Kelly C.,https://de.linkedin.com/in/kellective,,,"Hi Kelly,

I noticed your Product Designer role, and while my expertise is in AI & Data Engineering, not UI/UX design, your vision for an AI-first ecosystem at Code & Co. resonated strongly.

As a freelance AI & Data Engineer, I specialize in leading the technical vision for novel AI-driven platforms, like my work as Co-Founder/CTO of a Business Intelligence platform, and deploying end-to-end AI products.

4335181670,Founding Software Engineer (Backend),"We’re building the future of fleet management with AI — and we’re still early.



Flottando is growing fast, and we’re looking for a Founding Software Engineer ready to take real ownership and build the backbone of our new AI products alongside the CTO and Head of Product.



This isn’t a “just implement tickets” job. It’s a chance to join at the inflection point, shape architecture and culture, and leave your fingerprints on a product used by real businesses across Europe.

If you’ve helped a startup scale before, know how to move fast without breaking things, and love to build end-to-end systems with impact — this might be the one.



What You’ll Do

- Build, scale, and maintain the core backend powering Flottando’s fleet management platform
- Work directly with the CTO to define architecture, priorities, and roadmap
- Take ownership from idea to production — design, implement, test, deploy, measure, repeat
- Collaborate tightly with product and design to deliver features that actually solve user problems
- Help shape our engineering culture, development practices, and tooling choices as we grow



What We’re Looking For

- 5+ years of experience as a software engineer — ideally in fast-moving startups
- Strong backend development skills (Python preferred — FastAPI experience is a plus)
- Comfortable across the stack: we use FastAPI , React , PostgreSQL , and AWS (serverless)
- You’ve shipped real products, not just internal tools — and you know what “ownership” really means
- You value performance, scalability, and clean architecture as much as getting things done
- You’re a clear communicator who thrives in async, remote-first environments



What We Offer

- Competitive salary + meaningful stock options — you’ll own a piece of what you’re building
- Fully remote role — work from anywhere in Italy
- Real impact — every line of code touches real customers
- High autonomy — no corporate layers, no PM overhead; engineers here drive the product
- Startup pace — you’ll learn and grow faster than anywhere else
- Team meetups twice a year (we fly everyone in — on us)



Who You Are

You’ve seen how startups work — the chaos, the speed, the grind, the reward — and you want more of it.

You don’t wait for instructions. You connect dots, move fast, and care deeply about what you build.

You want to be part of a small, elite team where your work actually matters.



Our Hiring Process

We move fast — usually from first chat to offer within 2 weeks.
