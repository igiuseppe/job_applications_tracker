4321641624,Prompt Engineer (H/F) — Agentova,"Remote · Part-time ~20h/sem · Démarrage rapide · Évolution possible

Agentova construit la plateforme n°1 d’automatisation accessible à tous.

Notre promesse : sortir les entrepreneurs du chaos opérationnel grâce à des agents IA reliés à un cerveau central qui connecte leurs outils (Instagram, WhatsApp, Google, Notion, etc.) et redistribue la donnée aux bons endroits — simplement, et surtout efficacement.

On démarre fort (déjà plus de 600 inscrits en ~1 mois) et on cherche un/une Prompt Engineer qui a la dalle, qui aime comprendre les gens, creuser, tester, itérer — bref, quelqu’un de curieux, débrouillard, et profondément humain.

Parce qu’être prompt engineer, chez nous, c’est pas juste “écrire des prompts”. C’est savoir penser, observer, sentir ce qui marche, et donner une âme aux agents IA.



Tu feras partie de l’équipe produit aux côtés du co-founder/CTO. Ton terrain de jeu :

- Concevoir, améliorer et documenter des prompts robustes (structure, garde-fous, style, critères d’évaluation).
- Booster nos agents IA : qualité de réponses, style, cohérence, enchaînements, “power-ups” par cas d’usage.
- Instrumenter & suivre les prompts dans Langfuse (traçage, scoring, versions, A/B tests, feedback loops).
- Créer des “magic prompts” réutilisables (templates modulaires) et des guidelines internes.
- Collaborer avec l’ingé pour brancher les prompts aux outils (on code sur Cursor, mais le nerf de la guerre = Langfuse).
- Faire de la veille constante : aller chercher les meilleures idées sur LinkedIn, les nouveautés du moment, comprendre pourquoi un prompt fonctionne mieux qu’un autre, et documenter tout ça avec précision.
- Travailler main dans la main avec les développeurs et le CEO pour tout ce qui touche aux prompts sales, marketing et stratégie IA — bref, tout ce qui rend nos agents plus vivants et plus utiles.



On cherche la personne qui sera notre seul(e) Prompt Engineer au départ — un rôle à la fois stratégique, créatif et ultra formateur.

Tu travailleras main dans la main avec nos 3 développeurs et notre CTO pour façonner la logique et la personnalité de nos IA.

- Tu es curieux(se), patient(e), introspectif(ve) : tu veux comprendre avant de faire.
- Tu as un bon sens du copywriting , du marketing ou de la vente (pas besoin d’être expert, mais tu comprends comment les mots créent une émotion).
- Tu aimes être derrière l’écran à tester, ajuster, mesurer — tu prêtes attention aux détails, tu lis les logs, tu veux comprendre pourquoi une réponse marche.
- Tu connais (ou tu veux apprendre vite) : prompting avancé, agents IA, Langfuse.
- Tu écris un français impeccable et tu comprends l’anglais technique (pour la doc et les ressources).
- Tu es curieux(se) du monde, des gens, de ce qui se fait ailleurs.
- Mentalité builder : tu veux shipper , pas juste réfléchir.

Concrètement :

👉 Ce n’est pas un poste ultra-technique. C’est un métier de curiosité , de création , et de patience .

👉 Tu feras beaucoup de veille , beaucoup de tests , et tu apprendras chaque jour quelque chose de nouveau.

👉 Et surtout, tu évolueras avec nous — parce qu’on te partagera toutes les dernières avancées du monde de l’IA.



- Impact produit immédiat : ce que tu conçois aujourd’hui est en prod demain.
- Scope large & varié : d’un magic prompt à la logique complète d’un agent (SAV, Sales, CM, SEO, etc.).
- Rythme intelligent : on itère vite, on mesure, on apprend.
- Équipe remote-first, communication directe, décisions rapides.
- Rémunération évolutive : poste 20h/sem, fixe à 500 € + primes évolutives alignées sur les résultats et la croissance (oui, on est une jeune start-up — ce n’est pas encore le job le mieux payé, mais ça le deviendra à mesure qu’on scale).
- Learning by doing + ressources premium (modules, quiz, tests modèles) — on t’équipe pour réussir.



- Langfuse (observabilité, scoring, A/B, feedback)
- Cursor (environnement de dev)
- Agents IA connectés à des outils réels (Instagram, Notion, WhatsApp, etc.)



- Fondamentaux du prompting (~4h + quiz & tests)
- Introduction aux agents génératifs
- Introduction à Langfuse (4 modules + doc)

- Revue de ta compréhension des agents et de Langfuse
- Q&A

- Amélioration d’un prompt + plan de mesure (critères, scénarios, métriques dans Langfuse)

- On cadre tes premiers sprints ensemble.



- Contrat : part-time (~20h/sem)
- Lieu : 100% télétravail (zone Europe bienvenue)
- Langues : Français obligatoire + compréhension de l’anglais technique
- Rémunération : 500 € fixe + primes évolutives , alignées traction & jalons atteints
- Démarrage : ASAP

Souviens-toi :

Ce poste, c’est pas un “job de prompt engineer” comme sur LinkedIn.

C’est une aventure pour quelqu’un qui veut comprendre comment l’IA pense , rendre les machines plus humaines , et grandir avec une start-up qui apprend aussi vite qu’elle avance .",Agentova.ai,https://www.linkedin.com/company/agentova-ai?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name,https://fr.linkedin.com/jobs/view/prompt-engineer-h-f-%E2%80%94-agentova-at-agentova-ai-4321641624?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title,2025-11-08 08:25:55,,,,"Entrepreneurial Co-Founder & CTO with a strong background in leading technical vision and developing impactful AI-driven products.

4334984758,CTO and Cofounder at a Mental Health Startup,"Are you a highly skilled and entrepreneurial technical leader with strong experience in NextJS and Typescript? Do you have a background in guiding tech teams and are you prepared to take on a significant leadership role as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Cofounder ? If you're motivated by building something meaningful and taking on substantial responsibility, this could be for you.

We are a startup in the mental health space with an active user base of over 10,000 people per month . We're looking for a CTO and cofounder.



Our Unique Cooperative Structure:

We operate as a cooperative, a model that has been foundational to our company from the start. This means we are a collective of cofounders who together build and sustain the company. Revenue generated is distributed as cash and ownership amongst all cofounders in a fair and transparent manner. Within this structure, contributions vary; some cofounders dedicate specialized expertise for as little as an hour a week. However, the CTO role is distinct and crucial – one of the three most important leadership positions in our company. You will have considerable responsibility and influence in shaping our technical direction.



The Immediate, Pressing Challenge:

Your first priority will be to resolve an ongoing issue in our user acquisition funnel. For several months, we've faced a problem preventing test-takers from consistently seeing their results and moving smoothly to the post-test funnel and payment wall. Our previous technical lead was unable to resolve this, and we've since parted ways.



We need a CTO who can:

- Thoroughly diagnose the problem and take clear ownership.
- Lead the effort to implement a working solution effectively and efficiently.
- Understand that ensuring the reliability of this core functionality is essential. This task requires a leader who can navigate existing complexities and deliver. On the positive side, you'll be building upon a product with demonstrated appeal, supported by good design and marketing efforts that attract thousands of new users monthly.



Your Role & Responsibilities as CTO & Cofounder:

- Guide all technical aspects of the company: Develop and implement the technical strategy.
- Lead technical meetings: Oversee architectural decisions and promote sound engineering practices.

🌐 ABOUT US We started our journey 10 years ago with a social app that paired individuals based on IQ and personality tests. We sold that company 8 years ago but recently reacquired it. We are relaunching it with a renewed focus on promoting mental wellbeing through self-help groups. Our team includes psychologists, engineers, designers, project managers, and marketers.



🛠 TECH STACK Our tech stack includes AWS servers, Docker, Github, Next.JS, Typescript, React, and Dart/Flutter. Deep existing knowledge of NextJS, Typescript, and React is essential. While expertise in the entire stack isn't required on day one, the ambition to understand it comprehensively for effective team management and contribution is important.



⏳ TIME COMMITMENT & COMPENSATION (CTO & Cofounder Path):

- As a key leader, we anticipate an average availability of 15 hours per week.
- Compensation is primarily equity-based , under terms comparable to all other co-founders, offering a significant stake in the company's success.
- The initial cash component for all co-founders, including the CTO, is only 10% of the total compensation package. As soon as we increase company revenue, we plan to increase this cash percentage for everyone in the company. This structure allows flexibility for other income sources while you help us grow.



🏢 COMPANY OWNERSHIP Our co-founder cooperative model, with the potential to evolve into a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organization), allows dedicated members to build substantial ownership through their contributions. You can learn more about this model here: https://psychometrica.org/legal/dao



🌎 OUR INTERNATIONAL TEAM You'll have the opportunity to work with an experienced and diverse team, including ex-Google members and startup veterans from Canada, USA, Kenya, Germany, and Brazil. Our company is based in Delaware, USA.

4338068608,Chief Experience Officer (CXO),"Tired of working on dull projects?

Want to help scale a design studio at the forefront of digital innovation?

We’re Berlin’s leading digital product design studio. We’ve designed two products that reached a valuation of over 100€ million. We’ve developed a validated sales funnel and doubled our team in the past year.



To continue this trajectory, I’m looking for a trusted business partner. Someone who can connect our clients’ ambitions with our team’s creative output. This is our first senior leadership hire, marking a major milestone in our evolution.



We have momentum, credibility, and an exciting roadmap ahead, designing cutting-edge products for clients around the world. What’s missing is a counterpart who brings operational clarity, client empathy, and product understanding — someone who can help hold it all together as we scale.

If that sounds like you, let’s build something extraordinary together.





As Chief Experience Officer, you’ll be the bridge between our clients, our designers, and the products we create together.

Your role is to ensure that every collaboration runs smoothly — that clients feel supported and informed, designers stay unblocked and aligned, and every product we touch moves forward with intention and precision.

This is a leadership role that blends client partnership, product understanding, and team coordination. You’ll bring structure, empathy, and consistency to our process, helping our studio deliver work that’s both strategic and beautifully executed.





Run projects from start to finish

- Lead the day-to-day flow of active projects, ensuring alignment between client goals and our design process.
- Handle client requests, feedback, and changes with clarity and calm.
- Set up new projects, define cadence and scope, and ensure smooth closure once deliverables are complete.



Coordinate the team

- Keep designers unblocked and priorities clear.
- Manage capacity and timelines to avoid both late deliverables and idle time.
- Plan weekly schedules, monitor burn, and ensure project health.
- Maintain a steady rhythm of team check-ins and collaborative design sessions.



Champion client success

- Build and maintain strong, trust-based relationships with clients.
- Anticipate needs, address concerns early, and make sure clients feel guided, not managed.
- Introduce clients to our workflow, tools, and systems.
- Recognise opportunities to deepen relationships through value and insight.



Shape the product experience

- Understand each client’s product in depth — goals, constraints, and evolution.
- Translate big-picture strategy into clear, actionable briefs for designers.
- Write and refine PRDs, product overviews, and process documentation.



Lead by example

- Model reliability, empathy, and calm structure.
- Support the team’s growth by bringing consistency to how we collaborate and communicate.
- Help shape the studio’s cadence, culture, and reputation for exceptional client experience.



- A strong foundation in digital product design or product management — fluent in both creative and technical conversations.
- A genuine love for clients, people, and process . You bring structure without bureaucracy.
- Excellent communication skills — confident with both creative teams and C-level stakeholders.
- A broad curiosity for technology, design, and how digital products get built.
- The ability to balance urgency and calm , keeping projects fast-moving without friction.
- A strong eye for detail and a high standard for quality.



- Previous experience in a design studio or creative agency environment.
- Familiarity with design systems, iterative delivery, and engineering handoff.



You’ll be joining a studio in its most exciting chapter — a proven foundation with room to shape what comes next.

If you’re ready to help us grow and define what world-class digital design feels like, we’d love to hear from you.
